     <h1>WHAT IS CSS?</h1>
      <P>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

        CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
        
        CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</P>
    
        <h1>HISTORY OF CSS:-</h1>
    </center>
        <P>
        <ol>
            <li><u>CSS (1996)</u>- allows the user to select font style and size and change the colour of the text and background. </li>
            <li><u>CSS2 (1998)</u> has capabilities that allows the user to design page layout. </li>
            <li><u>CSS3 (1999)</u>- allows the user to create presentations from documents and to select from a wider range of fonts including those from Google and Typecast. Uniquely, CSS3 allows the user to incorporate rounded borders and use multiple columns. CSS3 is considered to be easier to use (when compared to CSS2) because it has different modules. </li>
          </ol> 
        </P>

         <h1>ADVANTAGES OF CSS3 :-</h1>
         
         <P>
             <ul>
           <li><strong>Saves time −</strong>  You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.
        </li> 
           <li><strong>Easy maintenance − </strong> make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li> 
            
           <li><strong>Global web standards −</strong>  Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</li>
            
           <li><strong>Platform Independence −</strong>  The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.</li> 
        </ul>

   <p><b>Embedded CSS:</b>It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the styletags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project.
   <br> 
   Example of Embedded CSS:  <a href=">Embedded CSS</a>
<br><br>


<b>Inline CSS:</b>Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. Add a style attribute to each HTML tag without using the selectors. Managing a website may difficult if we use only inline CSS. However, Inline CSS in HTML is useful in some situations. We have not access the CSS files or to apply styles to element.

In the following example, we have used the inline CSS in p and h1 tag.
<br> Example of INline Css:  <a href="">Inline CSS</a>
<br><br>

<b>External CSS:</b>In external CSS, we link the web pages to the external .css file. It is created by text editor. The CSS is more efficient method for styling a website. By editing the .css file, we can change the whole site at once.
<br> Example of External Css: <a href="">External CSS </a>   
<br><br>

<b>@Import CSS:</b>The @import CSS is used to import an external style sheet in amaaner similar ti the link.
<br> Example: <a href="">@import CSS</a>
